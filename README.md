# 🧠 Conversational SQL Agent with LangGraph and Chinook Music Database

This project builds a powerful SQL agent that interprets **natural language queries** and executes them against the **Chinook** SQLite music database using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Qwen 1.7B** LLM from **Ollama**.

The agent is capable of:
- Understanding the database schema
- Generating valid SQL queries
- Validating and correcting them
- Executing the query
- Returning friendly, human-readable answers

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Enable users to ask questions like:
> “Which artist has the most albums?”  
> “Which genre has the longest average track length?”  

…and receive accurate answers by letting an LLM act as an **autonomous analyst**.

## 🎵 The Chinook Dataset

The Chinook database represents a **digital music store** with customers, artists, tracks, albums, genres, and invoices.

### 🗃️ Sample Tables:
- `Artist`, `Album`, `Track`, `Genre`
- `Customer`, `Employee`, `Invoice`, `Playlist`, `PlaylistTrack`, `MediaType`

Example structure:
Artist
│
├── ArtistId
└── Name

Album
│
├── AlbumId
├── Title
└── ArtistId

## 🔁 Flow of Execution (Agent Logic)

This agent is modeled as a state machine using LangGraph. The process is broken into steps that mimic how a human would query a database.

## 🧩 What Each Step Does

### 1️⃣ List Tables
- **Tool**: `sql_db_list_tables`  
- **Purpose**: Lists all available tables in the database.  
- **Why?** This gives the LLM an overview of what entities (like `Track`, `Album`, `Genre`, etc.) are available to query.

---

### 2️⃣ Get Table Schema
- **Tool**: `sql_db_schema`  
- **Purpose**: Retrieves the column names, data types, and constraints for only the **relevant tables**.  
- **Why?** Prevents guessing. The agent sees the **actual structure** of the tables it's querying.

---

### 3️⃣ Generate SQL Query
- **Model**: `qwen3:1.7b`  
- **Framework**: LangChain's ReAct-style prompting  
- **Purpose**: The agent constructs a well-formed SQL query tailored to the user’s question, based on schema understanding.

#### 💡 Example:
```sql
SELECT Genre.Name, AVG(Track.Milliseconds) AS AvgDuration
FROM Genre
JOIN Track ON Genre.GenreId = Track.GenreId
GROUP BY Genre.Name
ORDER BY AvgDuration DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
